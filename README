=== Prerequisites

  * SBCL (should be easy to port to another Lisp)
  * Pygments with the `pygmentize' binary
  * a modified version of stx2any available at

      http://bitbucket.org/skypher/stx2any/


=== Initialization

Build the CL-PPCRE core with

  ./build-ppcre-core.lisp


=== Usage

  ./transform-document.sh doc.stx

This will produce HTML output named doc.stx.html

Sections marked thus:

CODE_BEGIN lisp
...
CODE_END

will be highlighted as Common Lisp.

The main manual is in user-guide.stx.


=== Mark-up documentation

Documentation for the mark-up is at
